# **Update-a-file-through-a-Python-algorithm**

**Project description**

At my organization, access to restricted content is controlled with an allow list of IP addresses. The "allow_list.txt" file identifies these IP addresses. A separate remove list identifies IP addresses that should no longer have access to this content. I created an algorithm to automate updating the "allow_list.txt" file and remove these IP addresses that should no longer have access. 

**Open the file that contains the allow list**

For the first part of the algorithm, I opened the "allow_list.txt" file. First, I assigned this file name as a string to the import_file variable:

#Assign 'import_file' to the name of the file

#FFD700 import_file = "allow_list.txt"
